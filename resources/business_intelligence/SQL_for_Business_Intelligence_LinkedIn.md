# 0 What is a Business Intelligence

		Business intelligence (BI) is the 
		process of transforming data into 
		insights that help businesses
		 
			1. make better decisions, 
			2. optimize performance, and 
			3. gain competitive advantage. 
		
		One of the  most  essential  skills  
		for BI  professionals  is SQL, which  
		stands for Structured Query Language.   
		SQL  is a programming language that 
		allows you to communicate with databases 
		and manipulate data. 
		
		In this article, you will learn what 
		SQL is, how it works, and how it is 
		used in BI.

# What is business intelligence? (definition by IBM)

		Business intelligence (BI) is a software 
		that ingests business data and  presents 
		it  in user-friendly views such as reports, 
		dashboards, charts and graphs. 
	
		Analyzing this data helps businessses gain 
		actionable insights and inform decision-making.


# 1 SQL Basics

* SQL is a language that follows a set of rules 
and syntax to perform various operations on data 
stored in relational databases. 

* Relational databases are systems that organize 
data into tables, where each table has columns 
and rows. 

* Columns represent attributes or variables, and 
rows represent records or observations. SQL allows 
you to create, read, update, and delete data from 
these tables using commands called queries. 

* Queries are statements that specify what data 
you want to retrieve, modify, or analyze.


# 2 SQL benefits

* SQL is an incredibly useful tool for BI 
professionals, as it is widely used and 
supported across many database management 
systems. It is easy to learn and understand 
due to its natural language-like syntax and 
logical expressions. 

* Additionally, SQL is flexible and powerful, 
capable of handling complex calculations, 
aggregations, joins, subqueries, and functions. 

* It is also highly scalable and efficient, able 
to process large amounts of data quickly and reliably. 
Furthermore, it is compatible and interoperable, 
working with other programming languages, tools, 
and platforms.


# 3 SQL applications

* SQL can be used for various applications in BI, 
such as data extraction, transformation, analysis, 
and visualization. 

* For data extraction, SQL can be used to filter, 
sort, group, and join data from different sources. 

* Data transformation involves cleaning, validating, 
normalizing, and enriching data with additional 
information or calculations. 

* Data analysis is used to generate insights that 
answer business questions or solve problems. Finally, 
SQL can create charts, graphs, dashboards, and reports 
that present data in a clear and engaging way.


# 4 SQL challenges

* SQL presents some challenges for BI professionals, 
such as requiring a good understanding of the database 
structure, schema, and relationships. 

* It can also be prone to errors and bugs when dealing 
with complex or nested queries, and can be affected by 
performance and security issues depending on the size, 
quality, and sensitivity of the data. 

* As such, it is important to be careful with the syntax, 
logic, and parameters of your queries, test them before 
running them on the database, optimize your queries to 
reduce the processing time and resource consumption, and 
protect your data from unauthorized access or manipulation.


# 5 SQL best practices

* To maximize the benefits of SQL and overcome its 
challenges, you should adhere to some best practices. 

* This includes using clear and consistent naming 
conventions for tables, columns, and queries to make 
code easier to read, understand, and maintain. 

* Additionally, you should use comments and documentation 
for queries to know the purpose, logic, and results. 

* Using indentation and formatting will make the code 
more organized, neat, and readable. Subqueries and 
temporary tables can be used to simplify complex queries 
into smaller parts. Finally, indexes and partitions can 
be used to improve query performance by reducing the 
scanning and sorting of tables.

# 6 Here’s what else to consider

* This is a space to share examples, stories, or 
insights that don’t fit into any of the previous 
sections. What else would you like to add?

* SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming 
language designed for managing data in relational 
database management systems (RDBMSs). 

* It is used to perform tasks such as data 
retrieval, data manipulation, and data definition.

* BI engineers use SQL to query data from databases 
and generate reports and dashboards. They can use 
SQL to perform a wide variety of tasks, including:

	* Extract data from a variety of sources. 

	* BI engineers can use SQL to transform data 
	into a format that is suitable for analysis. 
	This may involve cleaning the data,aggregating 
	it,or calculating new variables.

	* Can use SQL to analyze data and generate visual 
	insights. Further can use SQL to create reports 
	and dashboards that communicate data findings 
	to stakeholders.
