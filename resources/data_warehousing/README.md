# Data Warehouse

	A data warehouse is a type of data management 
	system that is designed to enable and support 
	business intelligence (BI) activities, especially 
	analytics. Data warehouses are solely intended 
	to perform queries and analysis and often contain 
	large amounts of historical data. The data within 
	a data warehouse is usually derived from a wide 
	range of sources such as application log files 
	and transaction applications.
