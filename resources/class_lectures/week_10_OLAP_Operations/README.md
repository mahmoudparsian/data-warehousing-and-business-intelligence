What is OLAP?
OLAP (for online analytical processing) is software for 
performing multidimensional analysis at high speeds on 
large volumes of data from a data warehouse, data mart, 
or some other unified, centralized data store.

Most business data have multiple dimensionsâ€”multiple 
categories into which the data are broken down for 
presentation, tracking, or analysis. For example, sales 
figures might have several dimensions related to location 
(region, country, state/province, store), time (year, 
month, week, day), product (clothing, men/women/children, 
brand, type), and more.

But in a data warehouse, data sets are stored in tables, 
each of which can organize data into just two of these 
dimensions at a time. OLAP extracts data from multiple 
relational data sets and reorganizes it into a multidimensional 
format that enables very fast processing and very insightful analysis.

Understanding OLAP Cubes - A guide for the perplexed
https://www.keboola.com/blog/olap-cubes


Typical OLAP Operations
Roll up (drill-up): summarize data
by climbing up hierarchy or by dimension reduction
Drill down (roll down): reverse of roll-up
from higher level summary to lower level summary or detailed data, or introducing new dimensions
Slice and dice:
project and select
Pivot (rotate):
reorient the cube, visualization, 3D to series of 2D planes.
Other operations
drill across: involving (across) more than one fact table
drill through: through the bottom level of the cube to its back-end relational tables (using SQL)
